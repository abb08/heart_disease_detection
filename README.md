# heart_disease_detection

This is a part of my Graduation project

In this app I implemented a deep learning model (CNN model) that takes a phonocardiogram 
signal of the heart sound and detects any abnormalities in it to decide weather the patient's heart
is healthy or unhealthy.
i developed the model using python and a verity of its libraries like pandas and TensorFlow.


The app activates the model, gives the user the option to upload/record a heartBeat sound,
then does some preprocessing operations on it then feeds it to the model and gives the user the 
results
